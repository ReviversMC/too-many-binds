Some Minecraft modders have a bit of an obsession with adding keybinds. If you've ever played on a bigger modpack, you probably have seen the problem yourself - why do you need to have a dedicated key just to launch your minimap settings? Or, to show an overlay you'll probably use twice in the entire playthrough? Well - with this mod you don't need that anymore!

It adds a keybind search box, that allows you to use almost every other keybind by just searching for its name. It's even smart - it puts the most recently used keybinds at the top of the list, so you can easily access ones you use the most! The keybind for launching the search is named "Bind Launcher".
